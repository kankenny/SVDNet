## Remark on all files defined in this 'legacy' Directory 

---
###### 1. Keras-compatible compression layers do not rely on */legacy/svd.py
###### 2. *legacy/svd.py is kept (i.e., undeleted) as it is used as a verbose result of SVD for plots
###### 3. */legacy/adjust_corr.py is computationally intractable (time)
